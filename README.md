# 🎓 AI Assistant Usage in Student Life — Data Analysis Project

## 📘 Overview
This project analyzes how students interact with **AI assistants** in their daily academic activities.  
It explores patterns in usage, satisfaction, and outcomes across different student levels and disciplines.

Using a synthetic dataset from Kaggle, this analysis provides visual insights into engagement behaviors and satisfaction trends.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand how frequently students use AI assistants for study and learning tasks.
- Discover relationships between **usage duration**, **satisfaction level**, and **final academic outcomes**.
- Identify patterns based on **student level**, **discipline**, and **day of the week**.
- Build a foundation for a future **interactive analytics dashboard**.
